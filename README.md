# Imglitch
A series of Python image processing scripts to produce various glitch-like effects.

### Currently supported operations
- Pixel sorting, loosely inspired by Kim Asendorf's Processing script [here](https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort)
- Selective color manipulation to produce a localized photo-negative effect

### Dependencies
The Python Imaging Library (since forked into [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/))

### Usage
Simply run the script with a valid source image path (currently hardcoded in PixSort.py)

### Example output
See images_out directory in the repo

### Todo
- Implement CLI/GUI-based user input for source and destination images, parameters, etc.
